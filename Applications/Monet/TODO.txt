- change -makeObjectsPerform: to -makeObjectsPerformSelector:
- wondering about programming error in BooleanParser
- odd cases in BooleanParser, addSubExpression:self
  - it's totally wrong, adding the parser.  Sheesh!
- what does it mean to be "native"?
- correct spelling, change "editting" to "editing"
- it looks like one Point in "DefaultPrototypes" is bad, with list index of -1, secondary index of 0x5037312 (84112146).
  - actually it looks like three points.
  - look at similar code in Rule.m that checks for -1 value.
- don't call init methods in -initWithCoder:
- Parameter and Symbol look pretty close to identical!
- eliminate MonetList, replace with NSMutableArray.  Or maybe not, since it has an array, but is not an array.
- do we need to free the strings that we get from:
    [aDecoder decodeValueOfObjCType:"*" at:&c_string];
- probable programming error in original Rule.m:
        for(i = 0; i< 16; i++)
        {
                NXReadTypes(stream, "ii", &j, &k);
                if (i==(-1))
    - I think it should be checking "j" for -1 value.
- it looks like I'm getting different results when I load MonetBlank.monet twice in a row...
- I can't load "Play2.monet".  It looks like there's a point encoded as "di" instead of "ddii".



- make superclass for FormulaExpression, FormulaTerminal.  Check how this affects archiving.
- make superclass for BooleanExpression, BooleanTerminal.  Check how this affects archiving.


- would like from a working synthesizer/next machine:
  - sample sound files of generated speech
  - provide package contents as a standard tar file so we can look at the contents
  - sample files for the software synthesizer to have it generate speech
  - descriptions of what each of the ".monet" files is for/demonstrates.
  - does "Play2.monet" load for them?
