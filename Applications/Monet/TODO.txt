- Parameter and Symbol look pretty close to identical!
- do we need to free the strings that we get from:
    [aDecoder decodeValueOfObjCType:"*" at:&c_string];
  - be sure to free strings unarchived from typed streams.

- eliminate MonetList, replace with NSMutableArray.  Or maybe not, since it has an array, but is not an array.
- probable programming error in original Rule.m:
        for(i = 0; i< 16; i++)
        {
                NXReadTypes(stream, "ii", &j, &k);
                if (i==(-1))
    - I think it should be checking "j" for -1 value.
- it looks like I'm getting different results when I load MonetBlank.monet twice in a row...
- I can't load "Play2.monet".  It looks like there's a point encoded as "di" instead of "ddii".
- Hmm.  Duration form in Rule Parser window, text shifts when selecting it (tabbing into the field.)
- stars in rules after phones seems to match, i.e., ch and ch' for "ch*"
- check that we aren't returning floats/doubles from calls to methods that might return nil;
- we could filter the rules, showing which ones match a given symbol input.
- we could add a column to the rule list to show the total combinations matched.



Done
+ change -makeObjectsPerform: to -makeObjectsPerformSelector:
+ wondering about programming error in BooleanParser
  + Caused by Openstep conversion scripts
+ odd cases in BooleanParser, addSubExpression:self
  + it's totally wrong, adding the parser.  Sheesh!
  + again, caused by Openstep convertion scripts
+ what does it mean to be "native"?
+ correct spelling, change "editting" to "editing"
+ don't call init methods in -initWithCoder:
+ I think -[PointInspector browserHit:] was wrong with:
                [tempProto findEquation:listIndex andIndex:    index];
                temp = tempProto;
                [currentPoint setExpression:temp];

  I think it should be this:
                temp = [tempProto findEquation:listIndex andIndex:    index];
                [currentPoint setExpression:temp];
+ there was some really bogus conversion in PhoneInspector.m, in browserHit:, where this:
	case 1: tempList = [currentPhone parameterList];
  was converted to this:
      case 1: [currentPhone parameterList]; tempList = currentPhone;
  What?!
+ fixed spelling of "parmeters" in Phone init method
+ rename Phone to Posture
+ move the NSRunAlertPanel() call out of SlopeRatio!
  + and adding points to slopes doesn't quite work properly right now -- another slope doesn't get added?
+ it looks like one Point in "DefaultPrototypes" is bad, with list index of -1, secondary index of 0x5037312 (84112146).
  + actually it looks like three points.
  + look at similar code in Rule.m that checks for -1 value.

TODO:
- if a value is at the default, and then you change the default, do you want all of the instances to change as well?  I think so.
- phones have a "native" category, which is their name.  This is probably so that the boolean parser can just looks up categories, not categories and phones.



- make superclass for FormulaExpression, FormulaTerminal.  Check how this affects archiving.
- make superclass for BooleanExpression, BooleanTerminal.  Check how this affects archiving.


- would like from a working synthesizer/next machine:
  - sample sound files of generated speech
  / provide package contents as a standard tar file so we can look at the contents
  - sample files for the software synthesizer to have it generate speech
  - descriptions of what each of the ".monet" files is for/demonstrates.
  - does "Play2.monet" load for them?



- merge Parameter, Symbol classes
- remove "native" category
  - update boolean parser to recognize postures at well



Notes:
- bezier paths may need to be on 1/2 pixel coordinates, depending on the line width.
- when using NSRectFill you need to use integral coordinates.
- I see that the time formulas should produce monotonically increasing values for times.  Fricatives/Dud12 is an example that doesn't do this.



2004-03-12:
- BUG: slope ratio button for diZeroTwelveOne doesn't go all the way to the left.
       - nor does Diphtong,
- graph for fTransition is a little odd.  Phantom points?
  - seems likely.  Stopped/Default is similar, but looks fine.
- Carre/bLipClosure give a nice example.
- Fricatives/sOrzFricCharParams is an example of overlapping slope numbers

2004-03-15:
- Would it be useful to list the timing symbols in order for the TransitionView?
- inspecting zero points should show "No Inspector", not "Multiple Points Selected"
- when dragging to select points and no points are selected, the point inspector shows "No Inspector" and "Multiple Points Selected"
- you shouldn't be able to (try to) set the value for a point that is part of a slope ratio.
  + try M prefix for remaining object (MMonetModel, MTransitionView, MInspector, ...)
- Just noticed that "Drift Parmeters" is misspelled in the original Intonation Window.
- Rename classes
  + Phone -> MMPosture
  - NamedList -> MMGroup (where appropriate)
  + CateogoryNode -> MMCategory
  + Parameter -> MMParameter
  - Symbol -> MMParameter
  + Point(GSMPoint) -> MMPoint
  + Rule -> MMRule
  + ProtoEquation -> MMEquation
  + ProtoTemplate -> MMTransition
  - GSParser -> MParser
  + Slope -> MMSlope
  + SlopeRatio -> MMSlopeRatio
  + Target -> MMTarget


2004-03-18:
- need to be sure to set model when we add postures.

2004-03-21:
- maybe try "MA" as the prefix for "Monet App"

2004-03-22:
- show list of points in transition editor, for easier selection when things go bad (points off screen, multiple points as same place)

2004-03-23:
- -[NSSString initWithBytes:length:encoding:] not in 10.2.8 SDK, so should be within #if in 10.3 header file.
- text of NSForm shifts slightly when selected.  This doesn't happen with NSTextFields.
  - for vertical form.  Single horizontal form doesn't seem to have that problem.

2004-03-24:
- In the rule manager we could have a column to show the running total combinations that can reach each rule
  - this would take the total possible combinations, minus all of the ones matched above it.
  - I think this would be difficult to do.
- In MMRule, key the transitions and special transitions by name, so we can easily change the order.  (Of course,
  that makes changing the name a bit more work.)
- There seems to be Posture Symbols and Rule Symbols
