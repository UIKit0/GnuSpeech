Here are some timings that I did a while ago.  This is for a 17 second utterance (I think it's 10 repetitions of one of the test parameter files, so there isn't a large parameter list.)  David ran it on his 1.6GHz G5 and the Linux machine, although he may not have had optimizations turned on.  I ran the others on my machines.

r180  - Len's new tube that can generate au, aiff, or wav.
r181  - Updated to remove linear search through parameters.
r447  - Updated with some simple optimizations, optimization flags to compiler.
r447 (tube2) - a minor experiment with using Altivec.
r577  - split into several files with no real attempt at optimization,
        or using optimization flags for the compiler.
r947  - GnuSpeech 2004-08-24 package, some vecLib optimization.
r1016 - current head, exp2, vecLib & dual window for FIR, -O3 instead of -Os,
        eliminated temporary file.

I used the Computer Hardware Understanding Development (CHUD) tools to disable the second CPU on my desktop to get the numbers for the single 1GHz PPC above.  There aren't enough input parameters to make much of a difference between r180 and r181.  I'm not sure exactly what version I gave David (that part wasn't tagged), but it should be about r447.

The two 500MHz machines are roughly the same speed with r180.  What really struck me is that the times for the 1.6GHz G5 and the 1GHz G4 are about the same.  I think you can have the compiler optimize for G5 and/or generate G5 only code and that may help a bit.

So we're at around three times realtime on a 500MHz PPC, and almost six times realtime on the dual 1GHz PPC.

- The sample is for a 13 cm tube, close to the 10 cm minimum.
